# Basic Concepts

###
- PCB
- Computer
- Input/Output = Electronic Signal

### Digital Signal 
- Television
- Represents On/Off Signal
- 0s and 1s
- Graph and State

### Analog Signal
- Transition Signal
- PWM Graph

### Wiring
- Long = +
- Short = -

### Arduino
- What is `setup()` and `loop()`
- `digitalWrite` meaning
- `Pinmode` meaning/description
- delay, blink example -> blocking

### Current / Voltage, Breadboard
- LED: Limit Current
- 
- 220 Ohm resistor

https://arduinotogo.com/2017/03/10/appendix-a-reading-resistor-codes/

- breadboard: metal plate
- series/parallel circuit
- voltage and shortcut LED
### LED Button Set: DigitalRead

- Serial Monitor
- Serial println
- 9600 baud

- Floating
- Pullup resistor -> Signal to 5V
- Pulldown -> Signal to GND
- 5V Resistor
- Active Low


### Variable & Number System
- Decimal / Binary
- MebiByte/ Bit
- snake_case
- don't use #define ....
- constexpr
